# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
Module 12

## Overview
- For this project, we were asked to create a dashboard that would allow test subjects to review their results from a study of the bacteria in their belly buttons. The dash board would illustrate the demographic data of the subject, a list of the top 10 bacteria cultures found in their belly buttons, a gauge chart that shows how many times they washed their belly buttons on average per week and a bubble chart of cultures per sample. 

## Resources 
- We utilized JSON data and created a drop down selection in HTML which would update a Horizontal Bar Chart, Gauge Chart and Bubble chart. We also hosted it on our local computer server to get around the CORS error. We also customized the Dashboard with Bootstrap and additional CSS styling. 

## Results 
- Below is a snapshot of the finished Dashboard.
